# Artifacts

Artifacts are rich outputs generated by the agent -- charts, dashboards, reports, and interactive visualizations. They go beyond plain text and tables to provide visual, explorable representations of your data.

## Artifact types

| Type | Description | Use case |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **React** | Interactive React components rendered in a sandbox | Dashboards, complex interactive visualizations |
| **Plotly** | Plotly.js charts | Bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps |
| **HTML** | Static HTML pages | Formatted reports, styled tables |
| **Markdown** | Markdown documents | Narrative reports, documentation |
| **SVG** | SVG graphics | Diagrams, simple illustrations |

## Requesting artifacts

You can ask the agent to create artifacts:

- "Chart the monthly revenue trend"
- "Create a dashboard showing key metrics"
- "Build a bar chart comparing sales by region"

The agent decides which artifact type best fits your request.

## Viewing artifacts

Artifacts render in the artifact viewer panel alongside the chat. They run in a sandboxed iframe for security isolation. You can interact with Plotly charts (zoom, pan, hover for tooltips) and React components just like regular web applications.

## Versioning

Artifacts support versioning. When you ask the agent to modify an existing artifact (e.g., "add a filter for date range"), it creates a new version linked to the original. You can view the version history of any artifact.

## Exporting

Artifacts can be exported in multiple formats:

- **HTML** -- standalone HTML file
- **PNG** -- screenshot image
- **PDF** -- printable document

Export via the artifact's export endpoint: `GET /api/artifacts/<id>/export/<format>/`

## Sharing artifacts

Artifacts can be shared with others via secure links. See [Sharing](sharing.md) for details.
