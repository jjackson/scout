# Deployment

Scout can be deployed using Docker Compose or manually with uvicorn and a frontend build.

## Options

- **[Docker](docker.md)** -- recommended for most deployments. Single `docker compose up` to run everything.
- **[Manual](manual.md)** -- run uvicorn and the frontend build behind nginx or another reverse proxy.
- **[Configuration](configuration.md)** -- environment variable reference for all deployment options.
