"""
Database connection pool manager for project databases.

This module provides thread-safe connection pooling for project database connections.
Each project gets its own connection pool to avoid creating new connections for every query.

Features:
- Thread-safe connection pooling via psycopg2.pool.ThreadedConnectionPool
- Lazy initialization (pools created on first use)
- Configurable max connections per project
- Automatic connection lifecycle management
- Context manager interface for safe connection handling
